Chess vs Stockfish on a Midi Fighter 64 midi controller

This project originated in 2017 from a team I was on at an Edmonton hackathon, and as such the code is NOT CLEAN you have been warned

## Requirements
- pip3 install chess flask flask_socketio mido pystockfish python-rtmidi
- Download the right [Stockfish binary](https://stockfishchess.org/download/) for your system, rename it as `stockfish` and put it in your PATH or maybe the `stockfish` folder idk
- Let me know if that's not all the requirements
